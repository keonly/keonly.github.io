## About

This is my personal website built using [Quartz v4](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) (huge thanks to the creators!) with some modifications. The submodule containing my notes is private because it includes content I do not plan to share publicly. Other than that, pretty much everything in this repository is open and you can take and use anything from here for your own Quartz setup (if you'd like, of course). But please do note that I'm no expert in web development, so some of the changes I made might be quite messy.
